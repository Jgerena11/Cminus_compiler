The following program is a recursive descent parser. The program begins by taking in a file and which 
the scanner begins tokenizing the contents of the file. Afterwards the tokens are passed onto
the parser where recursive descent is used to parse the tokens. the word 'ACCEPT' will be
printed if the grammer in the input file is correct other wise it print 'REJECT'.
